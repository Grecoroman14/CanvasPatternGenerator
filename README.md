[For fun, got bored with the project and stopped]<br/>
Generates a variety of downloadable 18" x 24" pattern canvas prints
<br/>
<h2>Get Started</h2><br/>
In the command prompt, run: node nodeserver.js
<br/>
Visit localhost:8080
<br/>
Zoom out, then add four different Hex colors, then click one of the three pattern generating buttons. 
<br/>
Boom! You just created some pattern art, add a filename and click the download button for a high-res image. 
<br/>
For the 'Triangle Button' I used http://qrohlf.com/trianglify/#gettingstarted library.
