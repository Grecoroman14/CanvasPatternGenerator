<h2>Get Started</h2><br/>
In the command prompt, run: node nodeserver.js
<br/>
Visit localhost:8080

Zoom out, then add four different Hex colors, then click one of the three pattern generating buttons. 
<br/>
Boom! You just created some pattern art, add a filename and click the download button for a high-res image.
