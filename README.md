# CanvasPatternGenerator
[For fun, got bored with the project and stopped]
Generates a variety of downloadable 18" x 24" pattern canvas prints

Get Started:
In the command prompt, run: node nodeserver.js

Visit localhost:8080

Zoom out, then add four different Hex colors, then click one of the three pattern generating buttons. 

Boom! You just created some pattern art, add a filename and click the download button for a high-res image. 

For the 'Triangle Button' I used http://qrohlf.com/trianglify/#gettingstarted library.
